<h1>'Havoc' (𝟐𝟬𝟸𝟓) 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑 𝐨𝚗𝗅𝗂𝗇𝚎 𝚖𝚘𝐯𝐢𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of Havoc and my head's still spinning like a washing machine on overdrive. The theater was buzzing, seat barely comfy, back screaming like a kettle. Popcorn kernels stuck between my teeth somewhere, bastards. But wow, the opening — bam! Right there. No warm-ups, just plunge head-first into chaos. I swear my brain's still trying to untangle from the mess of it all.

The sound was like a pack of wild, screaming eagles — raw and relentless. Them chases were just a blur of colors, speed cranked to 𝚖𝚊𝚡, my heart playing hopscotch with anxiety. Alley after alley, like some grimy maze, not unlike those spaghetti puzzles in kid books. Yeah, I’ve gotta remember, corner store T𝗈𝚗y asked me to 𝚍𝗈𝐰𝗇𝗅𝐨𝐚𝖽 Havoc or wait, was it to 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝗁 Havoc? Anyway, doesn't quite fit in a 4K screen, it's larger-than-life madness.

> There's this scene, seeped in shadow, reminded me of an old noir comic. Sprinkled with neon like it raided a kid's glowstick party. And the sound, the sound just wraps around like a snake. You feel it coiling in your ribs. Missing half the dialogue cause some dude behind me wouldn’t shut up about his nachos. Rainbow guns? Nah, more like fireworks styled by a rebellious teenager.

Man, there’s a bit — chaos cli𝚖𝐚𝗑, buildings eating themselves into the ground. Didn't make sense but who cares, it was wild. And I think I laughed at the wrong moment, amidst the frenzy, like giggling at your own funeral. Somehow poetic, like a clown juggling while Rome burns. Lighting was insane tho! Every shadow had a story. Note to self: havta catch this again sans distraction. Yeah, gotta grab a friend, wave Havoc in their face, make 'em 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁.

Oh, the plot, dodged it like it was cursed – think a Rubik's cube mashed by a toddler. Kept tugging 𝚘𝚗 threads that led 𝚗𝗈𝐰here, but hats off, the thrill ride was something else, a full-course buffet for the senses, except the 𝐯𝗂𝚜𝗎𝚊𝐥𝗌 were the lasagna and I’m lactose intolerant — get me?
